/* Take a look at the attached MarkDown file about a news article. 
You can check the original article from yle.fi.

Create a web page that has the same content as the markdown file has. 
The page should have

One h1 heading
Multiple h2 headings
Three images placed as in the attached file
All the names of the people mentioned bolded (like in the article)
One working link
The name of the author in italic
The ingress (the first paragraph of the article) as both bold and italic
In addition, the page should be in a single 600px wide column that is 
  centered to the middle of the screen. 
The images should be all 450 pixels wide. 
The font size of the text outside image captions should be 18pt.

Extra: Get to know and use <figure> and <figcaption> tags with the images. */
