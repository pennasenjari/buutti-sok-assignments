Visual Studio Code has a lot of useful plugins. Whenever you feel something
 could or should be easier in VSC, chances are there is a plugin for it. 
Most languages have their own plugins that make coding easier, and there are 
 plugins that are small prorgrams inside VSC, such as tools to use Docker, Git or Azure.

All the README files on this course are written in Markdown. 
To enhance your Markdown experience, install Markdown Preview Enhanced.
After installing the plugin, use VSC to create a new file called markdowntest.md and
 try some markdown features.

Sometimes you need to generate text to fill your web page just to see how text would look.
You could just keyboard smash it, but more elegant way is to use Lorem Ipsum.
Instead of copypasting from a web page, install the Lorem Ipsum plugin.
After installing the plugin, create a new file called loremtext.txt and generate
 a few lines, and then a few paragraphs of pseudolatin in it.

Some of the most important tools are often neglected. Install Bongo Cat and learn to use it.
