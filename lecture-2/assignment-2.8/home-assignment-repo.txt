Create a private repository in GitLab for your future assignments.
Add teachers to the repository as Maintainer members.

Name it assignments-lastname-firstname for example: assignments-virtanen-jukka

Clone the repo to your computer, and move your earlier lecture-1 folder
  to this repository. Do not move git assignments here since moving git
  repositories and having them inside one another will cause problems!

Push the changes to GitLab and see if you can see your lecture-1 folder in GitLab.
