Using the command line (PowerShell) or File Explorer:

Create a folder for all your home assignments on the course.
You can freely choose where to create it, but the Documents folder
of your user profile could be a good choice.

Move your previously made lecture-1 folder into this new assignment folder.

You will use this folder until we get familiarized with git.
Create new subfloder for each assignment ie. lecture-1/assignment-1.6,
lecture-1/assignment-1.7 etc.

At this point you should have a folder structure that looks something like this:
