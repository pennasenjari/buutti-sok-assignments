Create a new directory named lecture-1 under the C: drive.
Create a sub-directory named assignment-1.2
Inside that directory, create a new text document named hello.txt
Inside that directory, create a sub-directory and name it images
Find some nice image on the Internet and save it to the images directory
Copy hello.txt to the images directory
