Create a HTML labyrinth. The labyrinth should follow the attached layout. 
  The labyrinth consists of eleven html pages. The first page (index.html) contains
  a link to the first room. Inside the labyrinth there are nine rooms (room1.html,
  room2.html, etc.), with varying amount of doors (shown as square symbols on walls)
  in each of them. Each page should have an explanation of where the doors are, 
  and a link for each door. Clicking the link takes the user to the corresponding room. 
  One of the rooms has a link to the exit page, which does not contain links back to 
  any rooms.

For example, when the user enters the labyrinth, the first room should show information
  like "This room has two doors, one on the east wall, and another on the south wall. 
  The entrance to the labyrinth is on the west wall." Since there are only two doors 
  to choose from, there are two links, each leading to the corresponding room page.

Extra: The default link colouring shows where we have already been. That's boring. 
  Use CSS to make the visited links look identical to unvisited links so the user 
  won't know where they have already been.

Done.
