Create a new web page with a h1 header "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet".
Add fifty paragraphs (yes, fifty) of Lorem Ipsum to the page.
Every ten paragraphs add a h2 subheading. Give each subheading a unique id attribute.
To the top of the page, add five links, one to each subheading.
Under each subheading, add one link to the subheading above it and one
  to the subheading below it.
When done, the user should be able to move between the subheadings by clicking the links.

Hint: You can copy the HTML code from another page (such as from the lorem ipsum
  generator page) by using the developer tools "elements" tab.

Extra: Add a link to the top of the page under each subheading.
Add one to the bottom of the page as well.
