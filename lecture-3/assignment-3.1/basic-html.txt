Create a new index.html file, and fill it with the boilerplate code generated
  by Visual Studio Code.

Add the text "Hello HTML!" inside the body tags. Save the file and open it 
  in your browser.

Change the title of the page to "Basic HTML". Save the file and reload 
  your browser page. Where do you see the change?

Extra: What can you remove from the page so that your browser still renders the page
  as you want? Note that what you end up might not be (and probably isn't) 
  valid HTML anymore, but modern browsers can still handle it.
