<!-- 
We have the following list of students:

const students = [ 
  { name: "Sami", score: 24.75 },
  { name: "Heidi", score: 20.25 },
  { name: "Jyrki", score: 27.5 },
  { name: "Helinä", score: 26.0 },
  { name: "Maria", score: 17.0 },
  { name: "Yrjö", score: 14.5  } 
];
Create a HTML page with a "Toggle students" button. Add an event handler to the button
 so that when it is pressed:

if the students are not listed on the page, a table with the students and scores is added
 into the page. (This is the behaviour when the user clicks the button first time)
if the students are listed on the page, the table is removed
