<!-- 15.9 SLIDER
Create a web page with a green div. When the user clicks the rectangle, the colour
 changes slightly from green to red, until the bar is completely red. When the div is
 red and the user clicks it, the div disappears.
Hint: You can set a green background with CSS
  "background-color: rgb(0,255,0);" 
  and red background color with 
  "background-color: rgb(255,0,0);"
Extra: Make the div wide at the beginning, and make the it shrink a bit on every click,
 until on the last click it disappears completely.

15.10 FILE SEPARATION
Modify your previous assignment solution so that it has its code in three separate files:
The HTML code should be in index.html file. This file should not include any styling
 or scripts, just links to the appropriate files.
The CSS code should be in style.css file.
The JavaScript code should be in script.js file.
