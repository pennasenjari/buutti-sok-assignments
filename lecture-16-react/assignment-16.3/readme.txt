Create a new React App, and remove the unnecessary parts, like you did in the previous exercise.
In your App file, declare four variables, name, age, weight, and height. Modify the returned
 JSX of the App component so that it shows the person's name in a header element, and then 
 the age, weight, height, and the body mass index (BMI) of the person.
The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed
 in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms (kg) and height in metres (m).
