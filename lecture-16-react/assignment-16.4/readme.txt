Create a new React App, and remove the unnecessary parts, like you did in the previous exercise.
Create a new component, RandomNumber, which  should generate a random number from 1 to 100,
 and then render the random number with an informative text.
After creating the component, modify your App component so that it renders a heading and
 the RandomNumber component.
