Create a new React App, and remove the unnecessary parts, like you did in the previous
 exercise, but this time do not remove the assets folder. 
Create a new component, RandomImage, which should show one of three images randomly,
 so that when the user refreshes the page, a different image is shown every time 
 (or at least 2/3 of the times, statistically).
After creating these the component, modify your App component so that it renders
 a heading and the RandomImage component.
