/* Imagine that you have a deck of cards. If you have a deck of cards, get one.
Each card is numbered from 1 to 13, and for each number there are 4 cards 
  with that number. Design an algorithm for sorting the deck of cards so that 
  the numbers go from lowest to highest.

EXTRA: Also take the suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades) into account when sorting.

Reminder: It is best to do first the basic versions of all the assignments
  before starting the extras. The recommended flow is

// Sorting deck of cards
// Note: referring to first item of array as 1 here

// suits = ["club", "diamond", "heart", "spade"]
// Figured out this kind of array structure.
// deck = 4 suits, 13 cards in each = 52 cards
// In reality, the cards would be in random order.
deck = [[suit=>"club", number=>1],[suit=>"club", number=>2]... [suit=>"spade", number=>13]]
temp = []

1) sort by number

// pointer 1
for i = 1 to deck.length
  // pointer 2
  for j = 1 to deck.length
    if j > i and deck[i]["number"] > deck[j]["number"]
      // first number is bigger -> switch places
      temp = deck[i]
      deck[i] = deck[j]
      deck[j] = temp
    

2) sort by suit and number

// First sort by suit using the idea in assignment 1

// pointer 1
for i = 1 to deck.length
  // pointer 2
  for j = 1 to deck.length
    if j > i and deck[i]["suit"] > deck[j]["suit"]
      // first suit name is alphabetically "bigger" -> switch places
      // TODO: allow selecting the order of suits
      temp = deck[i]
      deck[i] = deck[j]
      deck[j] = temp

// Now cards should be ordered by suit but numbers inside them are in random order.
// Sort by the numbers.

for i = 1 to deck.length // pointer 1
  for j = 1 to deck.length // pointer 2
    // if the cards are same suit, set them in ascending order
    if deck[i]["suit"] == deck[j]["suit"] and deck[i]["suit"] > deck[j]["suit"] 
      temp = deck[i]
      deck[i] = deck[j]
      deck[j] = temp
