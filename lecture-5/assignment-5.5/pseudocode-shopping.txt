/* You are too busy learning algorithms to take a walk outside, 
so you decide to create a machine that takes the walk for you. 
The machine can only move on valid roads (red lines).
You can use the following instructions to program the machine:

Step() - move 1 cell forward, to the direction that the machine is facing
TurnL(degrees) - turns the machine towards the left by the given number of degrees
TurnR(degrees) - turns the machine towards the right by the given number of degrees
Repeat(x) { ... } - repeats the instructions within the block x many times

Write your answer in pseudocode using this syntax. 
The machine starts its journey from the Home location and faces north.

a) You want the machine to go for a nice refreshing walk so you can focus on programming.
Write a code that instructs the machine to walk through the outer rectangle
  (largest rectangle), ending up back home once done.
  
b) You want the machine to do shopping for you so you can keep focusing on learning.
Write a code that instructs the machine to go to the shop and return back home; 
  note that the shop has two doors (blue stars). */

a) Walk around the area

Repeat(4)
  Repeat(7)
    Step()
  TurnL(90)

b) Go shopping

// Go to shop
Repeat(7)
  Step()
TurnL(90)
Repeat(6)
  Step()
/* Machine is at the door. Now do the shopping by some means.
   Machine can only walk the red lines so it cannot go inside the shop. */
// After shopping go back home
TurnL(180)
Repeat(6)
  Step()
TurnR(90)
Repeat(7)
  Step()
