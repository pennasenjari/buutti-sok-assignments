Get a piece of grid paper and outline a 10x10 square area. 
Inside the square area draw a dungeon game map that consists of wall squares
  and empty squares. The map should have an entrance and an exit, 
  with a clear path from the entrance to exit. 
Inside the map, place three kinds of elements:

Door
Water
Treasure
You can use any symbols for these, just mark them clearly.
Each element occupies one square. Use three of each element in your dungeon 
  (three doors, three treasures etc.).

When your map is ready, write a program that instructs an adventurer to travel 
  through the dungeon, collecting all the treasure. The commands you can use are:

Walk: Move forward one square
Jump: Move forward ond square jumping
Swim: Move forward one square swimming
Open: Open a door in front of you
Take: Pick up a treasure that is in the same square
Turn(x): Turn to specified direction, where x is either left or right
Repeat(n) {...}: Repeat the command set in the curly braces n times

When the adventurer enters a square with a trap, they must enter it using jump command.
Likewise, when entering a water square, they must enter using a swim command.
To open a door they must walk to the square adjacent to the door, face the door, 
  and use the Open command. 
To collect treasure they need to be in the same square as the treasure 
  while using the Take command.

For example, to travel through this 5x5 example dungeon, 
  a possible program could be 
Walk - Repeat(2) { Swim } - Walk - Turn(right) - Walk - Take - Turn(right) -
  Walk - Turn(left) - Walk - Turn(right) - Walk - Turn(left) - Open - Walk - Walk

Keep the paper that you drew the dungeon on. 
We will use it later on the lecture to solve each other's dungeons. */
