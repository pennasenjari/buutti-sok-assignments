You have a bunch of small boxes in a line. The boxes are otherwise identical,
  but some of them are blue and others are yellow. 
Currently they are not organized in any way; the blue and yellow boxes are mixed
  together in a messy manner.
The image below is for demonstration, but there could be more boxes in the line.
Design an algorithm for sorting the boxes so that the blue ones come first
  in the line and the yellow ones come after the blue ones. 
The algorithm can do only one comparison at a time. 
You can't say for example "take largest of the three numbers", 
  since that would compare three numbers at the same time.

// Sorting yellow and blue boxes, blue first
// Assuming the boxes reside in array

// pointer 1
for i = 0 to line.length
  // pointer 2
  for j = 0 to line.length
    if j > i and line[i] == yellow and line[j] == blue
      // yellow is first, switch places
      temp = line[i]
      line[i] = line[j]
      line[j] = temp
