Use VSCode to write pseudo-code descriptions for the following programs:

A program that prints “Hello World!” to the screen
A program that has two numbers, a and b, with respective values of 3 and 5. 
The program calculates the results of summing, subtracting, multiplying 
  and dividing of these numbers and prints the result. Division is usually marked with /

EXTRA: Write pseudocode for a program that prints out all numbers 
  between 0 and 100 that are divisible by 3.

Once you’re done, compare your solutions in your group.

Program 1
---
print "Hello World!"

Program 2
---
a = 3
b = 5
added = a + b
subtracted = a - b
multiplied = a * b
divided = a / b

print added
print subtrated
print multiplied
print divided

Program 3
---
For i = 0 to 100 {
  if i % 3 = 0 {
    print i
  }
}
