/* Modify your answer to the previous exercise so that instead of a Rectangle class,
  thereâ€™s a Shape class, with the width and height properties. Then,

Add a getArea method to the Shape class, which returns 0.
Add a Rectangle class that is derived from the Shape class. 
  The class must have a getArea method that returns the area of the rectangle.
Add a Triangle class that is derived from the Shape class and also has a 
  getArea method that returns the area of the triangle. 

Create some shapes of each type and call their getArea functions to make sure
  that your code works.

EXTRA: Create a class for Ellipse. The area of ellipse is pi * width / 2 * height / 2 */
