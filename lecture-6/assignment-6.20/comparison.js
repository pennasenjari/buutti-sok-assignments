/* When you have two numbers, you can compare which is greater 
by using the > (greater than) operator:

const person1Age = 15;
const person2Age = 24;

const isFirstPersonOlder = person1Age > person2Age;
console.log(isFirstPersonOlder);
What does the code above print? Make an educated guess, 
then run the code and see if you were correct.
What is the type of isFirstPersonOlder? */

// Will print false

const person1Age = 15;
const person2Age = 24;

const isFirstPersonOlder = person1Age > person2Age;
console.log(isFirstPersonOlder); // false
console.log(typeof(isFirstPersonOlder)); // boolean
