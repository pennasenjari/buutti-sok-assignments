/* Create two numbers, a and b. Compare them using all the comparison operators 
on the earlier slide and print out the results from the comparisons. For example:

const a = 3;
const b = 12;

console.log(a > b);
â€¦ and so on for all the operators (===, !==, >, <, >=, <=).
(equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater or equal, less or equal)

Try your code out with different values of a and b and check how it affects the results. */
